# UnityScripts
Just a bunch of Scripts I made while "making" a game


BetterJump Script works in conjunction with the jump script. It makes the jumping more flexible. Doesnt work alone. I think.
The death Script does nothing yet.
Enemy Movement Script is not yet finished but works. Not up to my standards.
FirstPerson Script has a fix for the camera when the player crouches.
Grab Script works like a charm. Very proud :) .
The jump Script has the walljump included in it.
The manager Script hasnt been integrated in the game yet.
The mouseMovement script is pretty much just that.
The playerMovement has the normal movement in it, run movement, crouch and a slide that still needs more work.
